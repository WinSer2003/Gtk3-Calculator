# Gtk3-SI-Calc


A lightweight calculator app designed for **Hyprland / Wayland** setups using **GTK3** and **GtkLayerShell**.  
Supports unit conversions, enhanced math operations, radiation dose calculations, and a simple, sleek UI.

## Features

- cool math expressions (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`)  
- math functions: `sqrt`, `pow`, `log10`, `ln`  
- ISL(inverse square law) calculations  
- Unit conversions for:
  - Length (m, km, mi, ft, yd, ly…)  
  - Mass (mg, g, kg, t, lb…)  
  - Time (s, min, h, day, yr)  
  - Energy (J, kJ, cal)  
  - Pressure (Pa, kPa, atm, bar)  
  - Radiation (Sv, mSv, µSv, nSv, rad, R)  
  - Radioactive decay units (Bq, kBq, MBq, Ci, mCi…)
  - Electricity is WIP

## Installation

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** and **GTK3** installed.  
2. Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install PyGObject
```
## Usage
I recommend using this as a daily drive calculator and u can do things like put it as a keybind into your hyprland config.
